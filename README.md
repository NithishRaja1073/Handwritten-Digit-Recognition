# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition by Nithish Raja
Handwritten Digit Recognition Project using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) under the domain of Deep Learning. 

Programming Language: Python

What is Handwritten Digit Recognition?

The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. 
It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. 
The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.

Prerequisites

The interesting Python project requires you to have basic knowledge of Python programming, 
deep learning with Keras library and the Tkinter library for building GUI.

Dataset

MNIST dataset

In this Project

1. Import the libraries and load the dataset

2. Preprocess the data

3. Create the CNN model

4. Train the model

5. Evaluate the model

6. Create GUI to predict digits


Summary

On the end of this Project, we have successfully built a Python deep learning project on handwritten digit recognition app. 
We have built and trained the Convolutional neural network which is very effective for image classification purposes. 
Later on, we build the GUI where we draw a digit on the canvas then we classify the digit and show the results.
